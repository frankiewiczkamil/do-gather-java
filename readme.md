Exercise project for learning some tactical DDD and/or clean architecture techniques (eg pure POJO aggregate class,
with no accessors - just command methods).

It is an app for collaborative task management. It's (going to be) like a yet another todo list, but with more
features (many lists, shared lists, etc.).

There's also a [similar todo-app project written in next 13+](https://github.com/frankiewiczkamil/do-gather) that
uses some more fancy techniques, like event sourcing for task list aggregate.
